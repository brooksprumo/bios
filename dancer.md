# Brooks: the dancer

Brooks is an avid Lindy Hopper living in Austin, TX. He is driven by a continuous need to create something new and true to himself. He is also a founding member of award-winning dance groups: Lindy Hopper's Dozen and Lindy Hopper's Half Dozen.

Now a-days, Brooks is often seen dancing to jazz music, teaching how to dance to jazz music, listening to jazz music, trying to find new jazz music, or playing jazz music. He really likes jazz music. Brooks enjoys focusing on the rhythm of the dance, in addition to an understanding of his partner and the music.
