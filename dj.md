Brooks: the DJ
==============
Brooks began his DJ-ing on the radio; now Brooks DJs for dancing. An avid swing dancer himself, Brooks enjoys tried-and-true Swing music for dancing. Some of his favorite musicians are Count Basie, Lester Young, Earl Hines, Duke Ellington, Freddie Green, and Jo Jones. Brooks believes Energy is the most important ingredient for DJ-ing, and plans on demonstrating just why that is, the next time you hear him.
